# Carbon Impact on Global Temperature Analysis 🌍🌡️

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **CO2 emissions** and **Global Temperature Anomalies** from 1880 to 2025. The goal is to visualize how industrial growth and carbon footprints correlate with the rise in global surface temperatures.

## Key Insights
* **Correlation:** Clear upward trend showing that as cumulative CO2 emissions increase, global temperature anomalies rise significantly.
* **Regional Impact:** Analysis of emissions across different regions (Asia, Europe, North America).
* **Critical Periods:** Identification of years with the highest temperature spikes relative to emission levels.

## Tools Used
* **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX measures, and Visualization.
* **Data Source**: Historical temperature and emission datasets.
